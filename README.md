MontyHallProblemTest
====================

A test to check the monty hall problem. It was hacked together in a pretty short time, and I would like to excuse the sloppy code but python isn't my primary language.

Simply execute `python montyhall.py` and wait for the magic.
Runs with both python 2.x and python 3.x
